Positioning:
- Each tile has its coordinates
- A point can be converted to a coordinate using the tile it belongs and relative position 
- TODO: we need a transformation between z value of a Geometry and height in km.
- TODO: We need to find camera distance on each zoom level. 
- A scale indicator for each zoom level can be drawn to screen using a prefined image: We do not know dpi for the screens. 
But another image can be used to represent the scale. Window.devicePixelRatio should be considered. Or we can use pixel meter conversion information. 
- TODO: Will the scale be valid in 3d setting. What should be done?
- We know pixel meter conversion for each zoom level. (https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/#0/143.07/67.19). 
We can use this to convert between coordinates and 3d position in map layers.
